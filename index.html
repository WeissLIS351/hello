<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Sarah Weiss and welcome to my personal website.  I grew up in Maryland,
  but I’ve been living in Madison for a while now.
   I currently am a graduate student at the
  <a href="https://www.wisc.edu">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>
  in the Information School.  I'm working on my master's degree in Library and Information
  Studies. On this page I'm going to share a few of my favorite things.
  You can use the navigation bar at the top of each page to access different parts of the site.  Enjoy!</p>
<h2>On this page you'll find:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>recipes I love</li>
        <li>info about my dog</li>
        <li>a list of some of my favorite books</li>
    </ul>
